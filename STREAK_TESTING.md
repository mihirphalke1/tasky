# Streak & Authentication Testing Guide

## üéØ **ISSUES FIXED (Latest Update)**

### ‚úÖ **1. Streak Calculation Logic** - RESOLVED

- **Problem**: Streak count was incorrect (showing 1 instead of 2, max streak showing 3 instead of 2)
- **Root Cause**: Flawed consecutive day detection algorithm
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote streak calculation logic with proper gap detection

### ‚úÖ **2. Toast Notification Spam** - RESOLVED

- **Problem**: Unnecessary "Welcome back!" toasts on dashboard refresh
- **Root Cause**: Authentication redirect loop (dashboard ‚Üí landing ‚Üí dashboard)
- **Solution**: Fixed authentication timing and redirect logic

---

## üîß **What Was Fixed**

### **Streak Calculation Improvements**

- ‚úÖ **Proper Consecutive Detection**: Now correctly identifies gaps between streak days
- ‚úÖ **Current Streak Logic**: Only counts as current if it ends today or yesterday
- ‚úÖ **Historical Recalculation**: Comprehensive analysis of all daily stats
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed verification functions for testing

### **Authentication Flow Improvements**

- ‚úÖ **Eliminated Redirect Loop**: Fixed premature redirects during auth loading
- ‚úÖ **Smart Toast Logic**: Only shows welcome messages for actual sign-ins
- ‚úÖ **Preserved Session State**: Maintains authentication across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ **Better Loading States**: Clear feedback during authentication

## üß™ **Testing the Fixes**

### **Test 1: Streak Calculation**

1. Open your app at http://localhost:8083/
2. Log in to your account
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Run verification: `await verifyStreakCalculation();`
5. Check if output shows correct current and max streaks
6. If incorrect, run fix: `await recalculateStreak();`

### **Test 2: No More Toast Spam**

1. Navigate to dashboard
2. **Refresh the page** (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
3. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Should stay on dashboard with no toast notifications
4. ‚ùå **Previous Bug**: Would redirect to landing page and show "Welcome back!" toast

### **Test 3: Fresh Sign-In Still Works**

1. Sign out of the app
2. Navigate to landing page
3. Sign in with Google
4. ‚úÖ **Expected**: Should see "Welcome to Tasky!" toast and navigate to dashboard

---

## üîç **How Streak Calculation Now Works**

### **Streak Day Criteria**

A day counts as a "streak day" if:

- Task completion percentage ‚â• 50%, OR
- No tasks assigned but focus time was logged

### **Consecutive Day Logic**

- ‚úÖ Analyzes every single calendar day
- ‚úÖ Detects gaps that break streaks
- ‚úÖ Only counts truly consecutive sequences
- ‚úÖ Current streak must include today or yesterday

### **Example Calculation**

```
Day 1: 60% completion ‚úÖ (streak day)
Day 2: 30% completion ‚ùå (breaks streak)
Day 3: 80% completion ‚úÖ (new streak starts)
Day 4: 70% completion ‚úÖ (continues streak)
Day 5: Today - 65% ‚úÖ (continues streak)

Result: Current Streak = 3, Max Streak = 3
```

```javascript
// Verify current streak calculation
await verifyStreakCalculation();

// Force recalculation from historical data

## ‚úÖ **Status: RESOLVED**

Both the streak calculation and toast notification issues have been fixed. The app should now provide a smooth, accurate experience without unnecessary interruptions.

## Recent Updates & Fixes ‚úÖ

### **Latest Improvements (Just Fixed!)**

- ‚úÖ **Completion Times**: Fixed "Unknown time" issue - now shows actual completion times
- ‚úÖ **Compact Task Cards**: Reduced card height to fit more tasks in viewport
- ‚úÖ **Better Scrolling**: Improved spacing and visual indicators
- ‚úÖ **Visual Polish**: Added emojis and better color coding for task metrics

### **Fixed Issues**

- **Completion Time Display**: Sample data now generates realistic completion times throughout the day (9 AM - 5 PM)
- **Firestore Data Handling**: Proper conversion between JavaScript Dates and Firestore Timestamps
- **Task Card Compactness**: Reduced padding and margins to show 6-8 tasks instead of 3-4
- **Scroll Performance**: Smoother scrolling with custom golden scrollbars

## üîß **STREAK CALCULATION FIX - UPDATED!**

### **What Was Fixed**

‚úÖ **Consecutive Day Logic**: Fixed the streak calculation to properly count consecutive days where >50% tasks are completed  
‚úÖ **Gap Detection**: Now properly detects gaps in calendar days that should break streaks  
‚úÖ **Historical Recalculation**: Improved logic to recalculate streaks from historical data  
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Streak updates automatically when tasks are completed

### **How Streak Calculation Now Works**

1. **Streak Day Criteria**: A day counts as a "streak day" if:

   - Task completion percentage ‚â• 50%, OR
   - No tasks assigned but focus time was logged

2. **Consecutive Day Logic**:

   - Streaks only count if days are truly consecutive (no gaps)
   - A single day without 50%+ completion breaks the streak
   - Current streak only counts if it includes today or yesterday

3. **Gap Handling**:
   - Any missing day in the sequence breaks the streak
   - Days with <50% completion break the streak
   - Days with no activity break the streak

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. **Test the Current Implementation**

1. Open the app at http://localhost:3000 (or your dev port)
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Log in to your account
4. Run these commands in console:

```javascript
// Check current streak status
await verifyStreakCalculation();

// Check recent days' stats
await checkRecentDays();

// Force recalculation if needed
await recalculateStreak();
```

### 2. **Create Test Data** (if needed)

```javascript
// Creates test data for the last 10 days
await createTestStreakData();

// Verify the test data was created correctly
await verifyStreakCalculation();
```

### 3. **Manual Testing**

1. **Complete Tasks Today**:

   - Create 4-5 tasks for today
   - Complete 3+ tasks (>50%)
   - Check if streak increases

2. **Test Consecutive Days**:

   - Ensure you have >50% completion for multiple consecutive days
   - Verify streak count matches the consecutive days

3. **Test Gap Handling**:
   - Look at your historical data
   - If there's a day with <50% completion, verify it breaks the streak

### 4. **Debug Commands Available**

```javascript
// Check specific date
await checkDateStats("2024-01-15"); // Replace with your date

// Comprehensive debug (does everything)
await debugStreakIssue();

// Check last 7 days
await checkRecentDays();

// Manual verification
await verifyStreakCalculation();

// Force recalculation from scratch
await recalculateStreak();
```

## Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ **Correct Scenarios**

1. **7 Consecutive Days with >50% completion** ‚Üí Streak = 7
2. **3 days, then 1 day <50%, then 2 days >50%** ‚Üí Streak = 2 (last 2 days)
3. **5 days >50%, then gap (no tasks), then 3 days >50%** ‚Üí Streak = 3 (last 3 days)
4. **Today only >50% completion** ‚Üí Streak = 1

### ‚ùå **Scenarios That Should Break Streaks**

1. **Missing a day** (no tasks, no focus time)
2. **Day with <50% task completion** and no focus time
3. **Multiple days gap**

## Visual Verification

### **In the Calendar View**:

- üü¢ Green days (90-100%) = Excellent streak days
- üü° Yellow days (70-89%) = Good streak days
- üü† Orange days (50-69%) = Minimum streak days
- üî¥ Red days (<50%) = Streak breakers
- ‚ö™ Gray days = No activity (streak breakers)

### **In the Streak Button**:

- The flame icon should show your current consecutive streak
- Hover tooltip shows detailed streak info
- Badge color indicates streak strength

## Troubleshooting

### **If Streak Seems Wrong**:

1. Run `await debugStreakIssue()` in console
2. Check the console output for detailed analysis
3. Look for gaps or days with <50% completion
4. Verify the streak is calculating consecutive days correctly

### **If Functions Don't Work**:

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Ensure you're using the latest version

### **Common Issues**:

- **Streak shows 0 but should be higher**: Run `await recalculateStreak()`
- **Streak too high**: Check for days that should have broken it with `await verifyStreakCalculation()`
- **Functions not found**: Refresh page to reload debug functions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Streak correctly counts consecutive days with >50% completion
- [ ] Gaps in days properly break streaks
- [ ] Days with <50% completion break streaks
- [ ] Current streak only counts if it includes today/yesterday
- [ ] Calendar shows correct color coding
- [ ] Streak button displays correct count
- [ ] Debug functions work in console
- [ ] Recalculation functions work properly

The streak feature should now work correctly based on consecutive days with >50% task completion! üî•

## Console Functions (Development Mode)

Open browser console and try:

```javascript
// Create sample data with realistic completion times
window.createSampleStreakData();

// Reload streak data
window.reloadStreakData();
```

## Database Collections

The streak feature uses these Firestore collections:

- `streakData` - User streak information
- `dailyStats` - Daily productivity statistics with proper timestamp handling
- `tasks` - Task data (existing)
- `focusSessions` - Focus session data (existing)

## Troubleshooting

### **NEW: Completion Time Issues (FIXED!)**

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Completion times now display correctly

- Sample data generates realistic times between 9 AM - 5 PM
- Firestore properly stores and retrieves JavaScript Date objects
- UI displays formatted times like "2:15 PM" instead of "Unknown time"

### **NEW: Viewport & Scrolling (IMPROVED!)**

‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Better task list experience

- Compact cards show 6-8 tasks instead of 3-4
- Reduced padding and margins for efficiency
- Improved visual hierarchy with emojis (üçÖ for pomodoros)
- Better color coding for different metrics

### "Invalid time value" errors

**Fixed in latest version**: The app now has robust date handling

- All date parsing is wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Safe fallbacks are provided for invalid dates
- Console warnings will show any date parsing issues
- If you see this error, refresh the page and check console logs

### Calendar shows "No activity" for all days

- Check if tasks and focus sessions exist in your account
- Run `window.createSampleStreakData()` in console
- Check browser console for any Firebase permission errors
- Try the "Create Sample Data" button in the streak tooltip

### Sample data creation fails

- Ensure you're logged in with a valid user account
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify Firestore security rules are deployed
- The app will show an alert with the specific error message

### Day detail view is blank

- Ensure the day has actual task/focus data
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the calendar data
- Look for date formatting warnings in console

### Task navigation doesn't work

- Verify the task ID exists in your account
- Check browser console for navigation errors
- Try the "Test Task Navigation" debug button
- Sample tasks use IDs like `sample-task-2024-01-01-0`

### Firestore permission errors

- Ensure you're logged in
- Check that Firestore rules are deployed: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- Verify your user ID in the browser console
- All database operations should be filtered by your user ID

## Common Issues Fixed

‚úÖ **Date parsing errors**: Now safely handled with fallbacks  
‚úÖ **Invalid time values**: Wrapped in try-catch with warnings  
‚úÖ **Sample data creation**: Improved error handling and logging  
‚úÖ **Task navigation**: Better routing and error feedback  
‚úÖ **Calendar display**: Robust date formatting throughout  
‚úÖ **Completion times**: Proper Firestore timestamp handling  
‚úÖ **Task card compactness**: Optimized for better viewport usage

## Testing Security

To test that the security works properly:

1. Create streak data for your account
2. Try to access another user's data (should fail)
3. All database queries should be filtered by your user ID
4. No data should be visible when logged out

## Development Debugging

Enable verbose logging by setting in browser console:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("debug", "true");
```

This will show detailed logs for:

- Streak data loading
- Sample data creation with completion times
- Date parsing operations
- Database queries and responses
- Firestore timestamp conversions
