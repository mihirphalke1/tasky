# 🔥 Tasky Productivity Streak Guide

## What is the Productivity Streak?

The **Productivity Streak** is Tasky's gamified way to help you build consistent daily habits. Just like LeetCode's coding streaks, your productivity streak tracks how many consecutive days you've been productive by completing your tasks.

## How It Works

### 🎯 Streak Threshold

- You need to complete **at least 50%** of your daily tasks to maintain your streak
- This threshold ensures consistency without being overly demanding
- Focus time and completed tasks both contribute to your daily score

### 📊 Daily Scoring

Your daily productivity is calculated based on:

- **Task completion percentage** (primary factor)
- **Focus time logged** (secondary factor)
- **Number of completed pomodoros** (bonus factor)

### 🌈 Color-Coded Calendar

- **🟢 Green (90-100%)**: Exceptional day - you crushed it!
- **🟡 Yellow (70-89%)**: Great progress - excellent work
- **🟠 Orange (50-69%)**: Streak maintained - consistent effort
- **🔴 Red (Below 50%)**: Streak broken - room for improvement
- **⚪ Gray**: No activity recorded

## 🎮 Features & Navigation
